# Reflection: Understanding Python Typing and Union

## Challenge
While working through Pydantic tutorials, I encountered the use of the `typing` library and the `Union` type hint. Coming from a background in set theory and SQL, I initially thought that `Union` might combine values or fields, similar to how unions work in those contexts.

## Key Learning
- The `typing` library in Python is used for type hinting, which helps document what types of values are expected for variables, function arguments, and return values.
- `Union` in Python typing means: **“accept any of these types for this field.”**
    - Example: `Union[str, None]` means the field can be a string or `None`.
    - `Optional[str]` is just shorthand for `Union[str, None]`.
- **Important:** `Union` does NOT combine or merge values or fields. It only specifies what types are allowed.

## Example
```python
from typing import Union
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleModel(BaseModel):
    middle_name: Union[str, None] = None

# Accepts a string
m1 = ExampleModel(middle_name="Alex")
# Accepts None
m2 = ExampleModel(middle_name=None)
# Accepts omitted (defaults to None)
m3 = ExampleModel()
```

## Takeaway
> In Python typing, `Union` is about type flexibility, not value combination. It tells Pydantic (and other tools) what types are valid for a field, but does not merge or combine the values themselves.
